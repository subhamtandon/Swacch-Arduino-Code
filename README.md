# Swacch-Arduino-Code

This code is used to open the lid of dustbin by sensing motion using a pir sensor.If this PIR sensor senses any motion in it's vicinity it sends an active high signal to the actuator which in turn opens the lid.
Using rfid in place of PIR sensor and sending the data to cloud needs some minute modifications in this code where all the other parts of code are kept same.
